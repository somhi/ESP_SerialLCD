# ESP_SerialLCD
Serial LCD driver Library for the ESP8266

This library has been adapted to work with the ESP8266 board 
from the original Serial LCD driver library developed for Arduino 
by Seeed Technology Inc.


This library is intended to be used with the Arduino IDE from https://github.com/esp8266/arduino which supports ESP8266 boards.

Place the ESP_SerialLCD library folder to your /libraries/ folder. You may need to create the libraries subfolder if its your first library. Restart the IDE.
